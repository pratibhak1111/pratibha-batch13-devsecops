# Git & GitHub Project Assignment — BoardgameListingWebApp

You will build this project **using Git + GitHub workflows exactly like a corporate team**.

**Base Repository (Public):** `jaiswaladi246/Boardgame`  
This repository is a Spring Boot full-stack web app (board games + reviews) and already contains files like `Dockerfile`, `Jenkinsfile`, GitHub workflows

---

## What You Will Learn

- Forking and cloning a real-world repo
- Branching (feature/release/hotfix)
- Commit discipline and meaningful messages
- Pull Requests + reviews + approvals
- Merge conflicts and how to resolve them
- Rebase, squash, cherry-pick, stash
- Tags and release flow
- Git error recovery (detached HEAD, non-fast-forward, etc.)
- A corporate-style GitHub workflow end-to-end

---

## 📌 Rules

- This is a **public repo project** — your work must be visible on your GitHub fork.
- You must use **branches + PRs** (no direct pushes to `main` except where explicitly told).
- Keep commits small and meaningful.
- Each task must be verifiable through Git history and PRs.

---

## 🍴 Step 0 — Forking & Naming (Mandatory)

1. Fork the repository to your GitHub.
2. Rename your fork using your name as prefix:

**Example**
- `rahul-boardgame-git-project`
- `priya-boardgame-git-project`

3. Clone **your fork** locally (not the original).
